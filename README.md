### Python 3 User Administration web application (CRUD)

To run the application you'll have to install **Docker** and run `docker-compose up`. After the containers are up, run `docker-compose run web python3 manage.py migrate` to run the migrations. After the migrations are done, the app is available on `http://localhost:8000`.
